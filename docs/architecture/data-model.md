# Data Model (Dataverse)

> **Target environment:** Sandbox `Collision Engineers - Dev` (`b3090c42-…`), not the default env (`858cf5b3-…`).

Distilled from the real **CE Job Sheet** (`raw/…xlsm`), the provider/inspection-address corpus
notes, and the case workflow. The job sheet's `Principals` and `Garages` sheets become governed
corpus tables; the formula-driven `Jobs` sheet becomes the `Case` table. **Source records (with
PII) live in `raw/` (gitignored) and seed Dataverse later.**

> All adjacent-repo material is **reference/ideas, not canonical** — this model is the spike's own
> working design, subject to confirmation (see the grill).

## Tables

### Case
The live work item (replaces the `Jobs` sheet — 31 cols × ~226 rows of formula-driven tracking).
- Identity: `vrm`, `caseRef`/source reference, `casePo` (generated at **parse-confirm** for instructions
  cases — see Case/PO below; the live `intake` flow stamps it in `Scope_generate_casepo`).
- Matching (ADR-0002): correlate incoming images/instructions by **VRM** into the single **open**
  Case; if none open, create one. Multiple historical Cases per VRM are allowed; ambiguous/duplicate
  matches are flagged `duplicate_risk` for human review (never auto-merged).
- Dedup (ADR-0010): **same-vs-new is disambiguated by claim/reference, not time** — a VRM can have two
  claims the same day. Reference matches an open case → attach; reference differs → new case; **no
  reference → staff confirm**. Exact Message-ID/hash repeat → drop. Never auto-merge on VRM+time or
  across providers.
- Readiness (deterministic): `ready_for_eva` only when the **required-items checklist** is satisfied
  or explicitly overridden — 12 EVA fields valid + image-rules + inspection-address decision +
  per-provider extras. Unsatisfied items = the **Missing** list; EVA submit is blocked until met.
  An image-based inspection address is an explicit override-with-reason, not a silent pass.
- Enrichment precedence: the **instruction/parser is authoritative** for mileage — DVSA
  `current_mileage_estimate` runs **only when the document has no mileage** (ADR-0006).
- Links: `workProviderId` (→ WorkProvider), `imageSourceId` (→ ImageSource, nullable),
  `inspectionAddressId` (→ InspectionAddress, nullable).
- Workflow: `status` (state machine below), `intakeChannel` (Email/WhatsApp × Auto/Manual; **Audatex out of scope**),
  `sourceMailbox`, `dateDue`, `inspectionDate`.
- EVA fields (the 12-field contract): vehicle model, claimant name, dates, accident circumstances,
  VAT status, mileage + unit, 6-line inspection address (or `Image Based Assessment`). Engineer
  allocation is NOT an EVA submission field — it is assigned inside EVA after submission (removed from
  the contract, B3 RESOLVED).
- Overview-only (imported when present, **must not drive workflow/readiness/matching**):
  insuredName, claimantName, thirdPartyName, claimNumber, policyReference, incidentDate, claimType,
  insurerName, repairerName.
- **Box one-way-mirror fields (Phase 7, ADR-0012 — APPLIED LIVE 2026-06-22, `25-box-schema.ps1` adds 9
  case columns):** `boxFolderId` (`cr1bd_boxfolderid`), `boxFolderUrl` (`cr1bd_boxfolderurl`),
  `boxFileRequestId` (`cr1bd_boxfilerequestid`), `boxFileRequestUrl` (`cr1bd_boxfilerequesturl`,
  `format:Url`), `boxSyncedAt` (`cr1bd_boxsyncedat`, **declared in `case.json`** — stamped by
  `finalize-eva-box` at `box_synced`), and `sourceMailbox` (`cr1bd_sourcemailbox`). **Written Dataverse →
  Box only**; the Code App *reads* them (e.g. to mint an "Open in Box" deep link) but case **logic never
  runs off them** — see the Box rule below. Plus the finalize submit-signal columns `submitRequested`/
  `submitPayloadHash`/`evaPayload12` and the `finalizedPayloadHash` idempotency latch (declared to close
  pre-existing flow drift).

### WorkProvider  (from `Principals` sheet, 58 rows)
Governed corpus record. Job-sheet columns map directly:
| Job sheet column | Field |
|---|---|
| Solicitor/Work Provider | `displayName` |
| EVA Code / Box Code | `principalCode` — **one code**; lowercase = EVA Code, UPPERCASE = Box Code & Case/PO |
| Inbox | `defaultMailbox` |
| Solicitors Instructions | `instructionNotes` |
| Drag in to EVA? | `dragInToEva` |
| Images location | `imagesSourceNotes` |
| Image based or address | seeds `inspectionLocationPolicy` + known addresses |
| Sending Report | `reportReturnNotes` |
Plus governance fields: `knownEmailDomains[]` (matching key — see below), `providerAutomationMode`,
per-provider toggles (AI/EVA/enrichment/outbound allowed), `inspectionLocationPolicy`,
`active|archived`, deterministic EVA-readiness overrides, audit history.

### Repairer  (from `Garages` sheet, 38 rows) — **first-class entity** (see ADR-0001)
A garage/bodyshop CE interacts with: `name`, **6-line address** + `postcode`, `email`, `phone`,
`figuresExpected` (Garages `Figures` col — whether the repairer supplies their own estimate figures),
`active|archived`. **Many-to-many with WorkProvider** (one repairer serves several providers; one
provider uses several repairers). A reusable directory you chase images/figures from.

### InspectionAddress  (per case)
The location on a case's EVA record. References a **Repairer** (`repairerId`, most common) OR holds an
ad-hoc location (storage yard, claimant home) OR the `Image Based Assessment` marker. Fields:
`repairerId?`, ad-hoc **6-line address** + `postcode`, source-label (repairer/storage/home),
source/evidence note, provenance link, and decision mode
(`confirmed_physical | manual | image_based | unknown`).

### ImageSource
The party that supplies a case's images/instructions — a **role**, not always a distinct org.
Fields: `name`, `kind` (`provider_direct | repairer | intermediary | individual`), `channel`
(`email | whatsapp` — **Audatex out of scope**), match keys (`emailDomain?`, `whatsappGroup?`/`whatsappNumber?`,
`contactName?`), optional `repairerId?` (when the source **is** a Repairer — don't duplicate it),
`workProviderId`s (m:n), optional default Inspection Address hint. Drives recognition of
non-email-domain intake (WhatsApp/individuals) and address defaulting. A Case carries `imageSourceId`.
**WhatsApp intake is manual** (Business app — ADR-0007); a planned timesaver bulk-imports exported
WhatsApp media and **OCR-matches images to Cases by VRM**.

### Evidence
Mirrors collisioncc `image-rules`: `kind` (image/video/instruction/email/valuation/eva_payload),
`imageRole` (overview/damage_closeup/additional/unknown), `registrationVisible`, `acceptedForEva`,
storage state, source message link. `registrationVisible` is **OCR-assisted from M1** (does an
image's OCR text contain the case VRM?); `imageRole` tagging is **manual until M2** image AI.
**Box mirror columns (Phase 7, ADR-0012 — applied live):** `boxFileId` (`cr1bd_boxfileid`) and
`boxFileUrl` (`cr1bd_boxfileurl`). `cr1bd_boxfileid` is a **correlation/UI mirror** the webhook writes on
accept — it is **not** the dedup key: durable dedup is the Evidence-existence check on the `box:file:<id>`
tag in **`cr1bd_sourcemessageid`** (see the Box mirror rule below).

### AuditEvent & ImprovementSignal
- `AuditEvent`: actor, action, severity, before/after, timestamp — every corpus/case change.
- `ImprovementSignal`: staff corrections captured during review (never auto-change rules) →
  Management triage queue. Fields: case, provider, fieldName, original/corrected value, original
  provenance, actor/time, affected-EVA-readiness flag, classification
  (`parser_rule_candidate`/`corpus_update_candidate`/`provider_policy_candidate`/`enrichment_issue`/
  `one_off_case_issue`).

### Chaser & Note
- `Chaser` (ADR-0003): tracked request for Missing items — `caseId`, `targetType`
  (`image_source`/`repairer`/`work_provider`), `channel` (`email`/`whatsapp`),
  `templateUsed`, `status` (`drafted`/`sent`/`responded`/`overdue`), `sentBy?`, `sentAt?`.
  **Channel-aware:** email = draft + (later) Outlook send; WhatsApp = **draft + manual send**
  (WhatsApp Business only). **Audatex out of scope.**
- `Note`: free-text — `caseId`, `author`, `timestamp`, `text`. First-class, always available.

### Field-level provenance (on each EVA-relevant Case field)
`fieldName, value, sourceType, sourceLabel, sourceReference, confidence?, reviewState, reviewedBy?,
reviewedAt?, notes?`. `sourceType` ∈ {staff, pdf_extraction, email_text, corpus, ai, dvla_dvsa,
document_ai, cloud_vision→azure_vision, web_lookup, whatsapp, manual_upload}. `reviewState` ∈
{not_required, needs_review, reviewed, conflict}. UI shows compact markers (`PDF`, `Corpus`, `AI`,
`Web`, `Staff`).

## Case status state machine
`new_email → ingested → needs_review → ready_for_eva → eva_submitted`, with branches
`missing_required_fields`, `missing_images`, `duplicate_risk`, `linked_to_instruction`; terminals
`eva_submitted`, `box_synced`, `error`. (Adapts collisioncc `case-status.ts` — reference, not gospel.)

**Two user-facing queues (decided), mirroring the job sheet's two sections:**
1. **Not ready / chasing** — `missing_*` / `needs_review`, with an active Chaser.
2. **Ready, not yet in EVA** — `ready_for_eva` (parked before manual EVA input).
Plus **Submitted** (`eva_submitted`) and **Box-synced** (`box_synced`).

## Provider matching — by email domain, not aliases
Match the sender domain after `@` to `WorkProvider.knownEmailDomains` (e.g. `john@carcompany.co.uk`
→ WorkProvider `CarCompany`, principalCode `CCPY`). Keep domains/codes unique enough to avoid
ambiguous matching and unsafe Case/PO generation. **Do not match on aliases.**

## Case/PO
`principalCode + 2-digit year + 3-digit provider sequence`, in **two case-renderings** of the same
characters: **EVA (lowercase)** e.g. `test26001` and **Box (UPPERCASE)** e.g. `TEST26001`. The Case/PO is
**generated at parse-confirm** for instructions cases (the live `intake` flow's `Scope_generate_casepo` →
`Update_case_casepo`), so it exists well before EVA submit. **Phase 7 (ADR-0012):** because the Case/PO
exists at parse-confirm, the **UPPERCASE Box folder is minted then** (`box-folder-create`), not at submit;
`finalize-eva-box` later *augments* that folder rather than creating it. (This supersedes the earlier
"user enters the Case/PO at EVA submit; Box upload happens in unison" model.) Future Box-folder sequence
discovery (highest existing number + 1) is deferred.

## Box mirror rule (Phase 7, ADR-0012) — one-way, Dataverse-authoritative
Box is an **additive content + intake + archival mirror**, written **one-way (Dataverse → Box)**. **Box
Metadata has no joins**, so **dedup (ADR-0010), the status machine, and Case/PO sequencing NEVER run off
Box** — they run off Dataverse only. The webhook receiver Function may *write* an Evidence row from an
upload (the byte store stays Azure Blob), stamping `cr1bd_boxfileid` (a correlation/UI mirror, **not** the
dedup key) + `cr1bd_acceptedforeva=true`; durable dedup is the Evidence-existence check on the
`box:file:<id>` tag in **`cr1bd_sourcemessageid`**. The receiver processes this fan-out **on the request
path** and returns 200 when settled (or a non-2xx so Box retries), then re-invokes the idempotent
`CS Status Evaluate`; case **logic** is never queried off Box. The Box columns above are the mirror's
footprint on the Case table.

- **Gates (owned here as schema; read everywhere else):** 5 Boolean `cr1bd_BOX_*` env-vars
  (`BOX_API_ENABLED`, `BOX_FOLDER_AT_INTAKE_ENABLED`, `BOX_FILEREQUEST_ENABLED`, `BOX_EMBED_ENABLED`
  reserved, `BOX_METADATA_ENABLED` deferred) + 2 String config vars (`BOX_FOLDER_ROOT_ID`,
  `BOX_FILE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE_ID`) — all default OFF/empty in `environment-variables.json`. Flows and the
  Code App **read** these; none re-defines them.
- **Audit:** 3 append-only `cr1bd_auditaction` options — `box_folder_created` (100000019),
  `box_file_request_copied` (100000020), `box_upload_received` (100000021).
- **Status:** unchanged — `box_synced` (100000009) already exists in `case-status`; Phase 7 adds no new
  status value.

## Governance (small team, ~10 staff — single-Management approval)
Management edits all corpus records directly (validation + impact warnings + change-reason for
risky edits + audit + rollback). Admin staff submit address/contact corrections → Management review
queue (not auto-active). Engineers read-only. No mandatory second review; risky edits need stronger
inline confirmation + impact counts. Referenced WorkProviders/InspectionAddresses are never deleted
— deactivate/archive/merge with old IDs kept as history redirects (Case/PO history depends on old
principal codes).
