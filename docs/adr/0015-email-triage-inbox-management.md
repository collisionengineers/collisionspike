# ADR-0015 — Email triage & inbox-management (deterministic MVP, LLM deferred)

**Status:** Proposed (2026-06-24). Relates to ADR-0010 (dedup ladder) and ADR-0014 (audit
case-type). Realised in Phase 8.

## Context

The intake pipeline only turns **attachment-bearing instruction emails** into Cases. The live trigger
guard `fetchOnlyWithAttachment: true` **DROPS every email with no attachment**, so queries, cold
enquiries and chasers are **invisible** to the system — they never land anywhere queryable.

The operator wants **every email** arriving at the 3 shared inboxes classified into a taxonomy:

- **RECEIVING WORK** — an existing-provider instruction / audit, or a new-client instruction.
- **QUERIES** — a question about existing work, or a new enquiry.
- **OTHER** — a catch-all for unidentified email (spam included). This is **explicitly NOT a
  drop-junk pre-filter**: there is little spam, **everything is categorised**, and spam simply lands in
  `other`. Nothing is silently dropped pre-classification.

## Decision

1. **A NEW lightweight triage table `cr1bd_inboundemail`** — one row per email.
   - *Rejected* **extend-Case** (would pollute every case tally / dedup / readiness count with
     non-work rows) and *rejected* **tags-only** (no queryable queue, no place to hang state).
2. **Two additive, never-renumber choicesets** — `cr1bd_inboundcategory` + `cr1bd_inboundsubtype`
   (option values are append-only, exactly like every other live choiceset).
3. **Classification engine = a deterministic `POST /classify-email` route in the parser Azure
   Function**, reusing `VRM_RE` / `detect_audit_signals` / the phrase tuples from `engine.py` (**NOT
   Power Fx** — re-implementing the detectors in Power Fx would drift from the parser). Unit-tested
   over a corpus.
4. **The gated LLM pass (`cr1bd_EMAIL_AI_ENABLED`, default off) is DEFERRED** to a later sub-phase and
   only ever sees `other` / low-confidence rows — the deterministic pass handles the rest.
5. **An inbound email links to a Case by the Case/PO number FIRST, VRM only as a fallback.** Each
   accident has its own Case/PO (hence its own Box folder), so the Case/PO is the precise key; the
   body-VRM is the fallback when no Case/PO is present. The link rule **NEVER auto-links on ambiguity** —
   a multi-match VRM is surfaced to a human (and true ambiguity is rare). The rare unplaceable upload
   routes to a Box "**dumping folder**" for human resolution rather than being guessed onto a case.
   Cross-reference **ADR-0010** (the dedup ladder's no-silent-merge discipline).
6. **New audit actions are named `inbound_*`** to avoid collision with the ADR-0014 "audit" case-type
   and the `cr1bd_auditevent` log. The word **"audit" is triple-loaded** in this codebase — keep the
   schema names, but distinguish the three meanings:
   - **(a) the `cr1bd_auditevent` action LOG** — the append-only record of what the pipeline did;
   - **(b) the ADR-0014 case-TYPE `audit`** — a re-inspection (Case ID carries an `A.` prefix);
   - **(c) the Phase-8 `inbound_*` audit-action subtype** — triage actions on a `cr1bd_inboundemail` row.
   These are independent; triage actions stay in the `inbound_*` namespace so none is confused for another.
7. **A raw `.eml` is retained ONLY when a Case is extracted.** For `query` / `other` email **no `.eml`
   is persisted to Blob** — the mailbox keeps the mail and the `cr1bd_inboundemail` triage row holds
   **metadata + a pointer**. (This corrects any earlier text implying `.eml` bytes go to Blob for every
   category.)

## Consequences

- **Flipping `fetchOnlyWithAttachment` true→false is a Phase-2 (live-activation) prerequisite** on the
  live `digital@` webhook. It exposes the flow to **ALL inbox traffic** — but **everything is
  categorised** (no drop-junk pre-filter; spam → `other`), so there is no pre-filter to build. Cost is
  **negligible and tracked as a MONITOR, not a ceiling**: the deterministic classifier is **$0** (it
  stays within the Power Automate seeded-run allowance at the observed ~1–3k emails/month), and the
  later **optional** LLM pass is ~**$0.21–1.50/month**. The remaining interaction to watch is
  **`concurrency=1`** (a sudden flood of non-work mail could slow the work queue).
- **Classifier testing is a planned Phase-8 sub-step (gated, operator-assisted):** the operator drops
  **real sample emails** into the Phase-8 folder and the unit tests consume them. Until that corpus
  lands, classifier precision over real query/enquiry traffic is **unverified**.
- **AI-test authority (G5):** the operator holds **full authority to run AI testing on all repo data**.
  This is the explicit enabler for testing the **gated LLM classifier pass** here (and the Phase-4a
  vision/geocode work) on the repo's own sample data. (The broader data-protection sign-off in ADR-0017
  is deferred, but does not block this AI testing.)
- The locked table + taxonomy decisions should pass a **`grill-with-docs`** review before the schema is
  applied.

## Update (2026-06-27) — platform migration (mechanism only)

The triage **decision** (classify every email; RECEIVING WORK / QUERIES / OTHER; a dedicated triage
table; never silently dropped) stands. The Power Platform specifics are superseded by the Azure stack
(**deprovisioned 2026-06-27**): the new triage table moves from Dataverse `cr1bd_inboundemail` to a
**Postgres** `inbound_email` table (with `inbound_category` / `inbound_subtype` lookups); intake
transport is **Microsoft Graph change-notification (PUSH)** handled by **`cespk-orch-dev`**, not the
`fetchOnlyWithAttachment` Power Automate trigger; the deterministic classifier is a parser / Data-API
route. The cost / `concurrency=1` notes about the Power Automate seeded-run allowance no longer apply.
